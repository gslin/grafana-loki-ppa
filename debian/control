Description: Like Prometheus, but for logs.
 Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log
 aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very
 cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of
 the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.
